App Description: Uses openAI API to develop a resume for the user. Uses mongodb for the login page, express.js for the get/post requests, and node.js for the server. 
-Start the server by typing node index.js
-open up http://localhost:3000
-Click on login
-login with your created credentials, and if you don't have one then click create account
-create an account and relogin
-now you can ask the bot anything and it will respond to your questions
  --if the bot doesn't work, create an account with OpenAI to use their api, and create a new apikey and replace process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY in line 29 of index.js with your new apikey and try again
